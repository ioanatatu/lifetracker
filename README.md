â€” This is my final project at Spiced Academy.

Because I'm passionate about self improvement and taking incremental steps to make changes in one's life, my idea was to build an app where I could TRACK my daily routines in order to have an overview of my habits and my progress over TIME (yes, tracking is a leitmotif of mine).

The idea also touches on two aspects of human nature: 1_we are visual creatures, so it helps to look at information presented in a graphical way, and 2_our memories of the past are not always accurate and get easily distorted by emotions, so we need data to confront them with.

The technologies I used make this a very over-engineered project, but I wanted to practice more React, Redux and learn how to integrate ChartJS library.

Please keep in mind we had one week to build our final projects.
